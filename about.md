Hello! Thanks for stopping by. My name is Lisa Goeller. A wise woman once told me "If you don't document it, it didn't happen." I'm using this site as a way to capture my thoughts on whatever I'm interested in at the moment as well as to document my progress over time.  I'm always looking to improve myself, so if you ever have any feedback or simply want to get in touch you can reach me at  `lgoeller@hmc.edu` or [add me on LinkedIn.](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lisagoeller/)
